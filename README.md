Analysis of machine learning models on the cummunities and crime dataset

In this project , I have studied various machine learning models for classification of data on the Communities and Crime dataset.
The methods are listed below:  <br>
1) Linear Model using Least squares  <br>
2) Ridge Regression Model  <br>
3) Lasso Regression Model  <br>
4) Principal components regression (PCR) model  <br>
5) L-1 penalized Gradient boosting tree using XGBoost  <br>

The dataset used is Communities and Crime data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime. 
The attribute to be predicted is (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units.
